<h1 align="center">SHELL4CHAN</h1>
<p align="center">shell4chan is pure POSIX complient shell script that lets you grab and display threads from the very intelligent website 4chan.<br>This shit is still in the early fucking stages of development.
</p>

## REQUIREMENTS

*  any POSIX complient shell,usually `dash` if you are not brainlet 
* `jq` fucking install it now

## Installation and Usage

```

## Functionality
The current version of this trashy Shell4chan has barely any functionality to speak of.<br>It just pulls and vomits out a thread from 4chan, and it looks as raw as your stupid face right now.<br>
This script is still being worked on, and more features and improvements will be added.

## License
This script don't have any license,do what the fuck you want to do with it.

## Disclaimer
Listen up, you braindead idiot.<br>The shell4chan script has nothing to do with the official 4chan website. Use it at your own risk, and don't blame me if you get banned or end up in some internet flame war.

### Will be added soon
* Images in terminal(probably with w3m)
* Support for multiple threads and boards,
* Perhaps you will have some options and filters for you to play with, you ungrateful twat.
* I might even think about throwing in some error handling, just to shut you up.
* Post reply
* Run thread on background and send notification if new reply was added
Feel free to modify it as needed motherfucker.
